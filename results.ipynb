    "# AI Code-Fixing Agent: Task, Solution, and Demonstration\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project was to implement an LLM-based AI agent that can fix buggy Python code. The requirements were to:\n",
    "- Use an agentic framework (like LangGraph).\n",
    "- Employ a ReAct-style agent with a sandboxed code interpreter.\n",
    "- Use a small, open-source LLM.\n",
    "- Evaluate the agent on the HumanEvalFix benchmark using the pass@1 metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates a solution using a LangGraph-based agent that follows a \"generate, test, reflect\" loop. The agent uses the `Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct` model to generate code fixes, which are then tested in a secure, sandboxed environment. If a fix fails, the agent reflects on the error and retries.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides:\n",
    "1.  A step-by-step demonstration of the agent fixing a single function.\n",
    "2.  A small-scale evaluation of the agent's performance on the HumanEvalFix benchmark."
